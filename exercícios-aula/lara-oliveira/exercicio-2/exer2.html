            Corpse Bride (also known as Tim Burton's Corpse Bride) is a 2005 stop-motion animated musical 
            dark fantasy film[4] directed by Mike Johnson and Tim Burton with a screenplay by John August, 
            Caroline Thompson and Pamela Pettler based on characters created by Burton and Carlos Grangel. 
            The plot is set in a fictional Victorian era village in England. Johnny Depp leads the cast as 
            the voice of Victor, while Helena Bonham Carter voices Emily, the titular bride. An international 
            co-production between the United States and United Kingdom, Corpse Bride is the third stop-motion
            feature film produced by Burton and the first directed by him (the previous two films, 
            The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach, were directed by Henry Selick). 
            This is also the first stop-motion feature from Burton that was distributed by Warner Bros. 
            Pictures. It was dedicated to executive producer Joe Ranft, who died in a car crash during 
            production.
